# savegit.io

## Goals

* Scrape as many git.io links as we can from various sources before the service is extinguished.
* Publish a public data set of each URL -> it's redirect in this open source project
* See how we can work with Archive.org once we have the data
* Create a new website savegit.io if needed that gives the link for any we have saved

## How you can help

If you think you can help out at all, please join the Save git.io Discord group where weâ€™re coordinating, discussing scraping strategies, etc.
